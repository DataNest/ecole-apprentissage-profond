    "Recurrent layers can be used similarly to feed-forward layers except that the input shape is expected to be (batch_size, sequence_length, num_inputs). By setting the first two dimensions as None, we are allowing them to vary. They correspond to batch size and sequence length, so we will be able to feed in batches of varying size with sequences of varying length. If `only_return_final` is set, it only returns the final sequential output (e.g. for tasks where a single target value for the entire sequence is desired). In this case, Theano makes an optimization, which saves memory. If you are working with variable size sequences, an additional parameters `masks` of size (batch_size, sequence_length) is given as a boolean mask where its entries are fixed to 0 after the end of the sequence."
